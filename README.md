# Snake-game
In this Snake game setup, we create a canvas, store the snake's position and direction, generate food randomly, and draw the game elements. The update function handles movement, collision detection, and lengthening the snake. Game over stops the loop, and arrow key events change direction. The game updates every 300ms and is styled with CSS.
